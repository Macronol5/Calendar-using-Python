# Calendar-using-Python

To create GUI Calendar Using Python, we will need to import two Python modules one for creating GUI and another to get year data.

For GUI we will use "tkinter module" because it’s very easy to learn and use.

And to get any year data we will use "calendar module".

Here, we are making a very simple and short program, but you can make this GUI application more user friendly like you can add entry widgets to get the year during the run time and show the specific year’s calendar by clicking on a button.

In case, you don’t know how to create your GUI application more friendly or how to add more functionalities to your GUI application then we recommend you our other tutorials like– Tkinter Login GUI with hiding password, GUI Calculator Using tkinter, Password Generator Application In Python, and Creating User-defined Entry Widgets.

We have clearly explained everything about adding buttons, attaching functions to buttons, adding text variables to entry widgets and many more.

Also, don’t forget to watch the short video which we have attached at the end of this page.

So now, let’s start and see the code.

We will understand the code line-by-line using comments.

You can copy the source code using the copy button below this line at the right side.
